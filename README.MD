## 🧪 How Deep Questioning Works

When a user input lacks clarity, Deep Assistant:

1. **Analyzes** the statement using semantic and syntactic cues.
2. **Generates follow-up questions** to clarify key details (e.g., "When did the issue start?" or "Can you describe the product you used?").
3. **Learns contextually** to avoid repeating questions.
4. **Synthesizes** a comprehensive answer or structured report.

> Example:  
> **Client**: "I had a problem with my last order."  
> **Deep Assistant**: "I’m sorry to hear that. Could you let me know what kind of product it was and what issue occurred?"  
> *(After a few turns)* → Logs issue type, urgency, product category, and timeline.
